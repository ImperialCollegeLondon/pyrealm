# Module reference for `pmodel`

This page contains the detailed documentation of the functions and classes in the `pyrealm.pmodel` module. The documentation describes the key equations used in each member. In particular, note that the documentation of functions and methods includes two lists of parameters:

* **Parameters**. These are the arguments in the function or class signature.
* **Other parameters**. These are the underlying parameters of the P model described in the [parameters](pyrealm.params) documentation. These can be changed by the user but have a global effect rather than just altering a single function.
