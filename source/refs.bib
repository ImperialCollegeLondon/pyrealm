  abstract = {Leaf dark respiration (Rdark ) is an important yet poorly quantified component of the global carbon cycle. Given this, we analyzed a new global database of Rdark and associated leaf traits. Data for 899 species were compiled from 100 sites (from the Arctic to the tropics). Several woody and nonwoody plant functional types (PFTs) were represented. Mixed-effects models were used to disentangle sources of variation in Rdark . Area-based Rdark at the prevailing average daily growth temperature (T) of each site increased only twofold from the Arctic to the tropics, despite a 20\textdegree C increase in growing T (8-28\textdegree C). By contrast, Rdark at a standard T (25\textdegree C, Rdark (25) ) was threefold higher in the Arctic than in the tropics, and twofold higher at arid than at mesic sites. Species and PFTs at cold sites exhibited higher Rdark (25) at a given photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax (25) ) or leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]) than species at warmer sites. Rdark (25) values at any given Vcmax (25) or [N] were higher in herbs than in woody plants. The results highlight variation in Rdark among species and across global gradients in T and aridity. In addition to their ecological significance, the results provide a framework for improving representation of Rdark in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) and associated land-surface components of Earth system models (ESMs).},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Gross primary production (GPP) by terrestrial ecosystems is the largest flux in the global carbon cycle, and its continuing increase in response to environmental changes is key to land ecosystems' capacity to offset anthropogenic CO               2               emissions. However, the CO               2               - and climate-sensitivities of GPP vary among models. We applied the `P model'\textemdash a parameter-sparse and extensively tested light use efficiency (LUE) model, driven by CO               2               , climate and remotely sensed greenness data\textemdash at 29 sites with multi-year eddy-covariance flux measurements. Observed (both positive and negative) GPP trends at these sites were predicted, albeit with some bias. Increasing LUE (due to rising atmospheric CO               2               concentration) and green vegetation cover were the primary controls of modelled GPP trends across sites. Global GPP simulated by the same model increased by 0.46 {$\pm$} 0.09 Pg C yr               \textendash 2               during 1982\textendash 2016. This increase falls in the mid-range rate of simulated increase by the TRENDY v8 ensemble of state-of-the-art ecosystem models. The modelled LUE increase during 1900\textendash 2013 was 15\%, similar to a published estimate based on deuterium isotopomers. Rising CO               2               was the largest contributor to the modelled GPP increase. Greening, which may in part be caused by rising CO               2               , ranked second but dominated the modelled GPP change over large areas, including semi-arid vegetation on all continents. Warming caused a small net reduction in modelled global GPP, but dominated the modelled GPP increase in high northern latitudes. These findings strengthen the evidence that rising LUE due to rising CO               2               level and increased green vegetation cover (fAPAR) are the main causes of increasing GPP, and thereby, the terrestrial carbon sink.},

We test an implementation of an optimal stomatal conductance model within the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model (LSM). In common with many LSMs, CABLE does not differentiate between \textexclamdown i\textquestiondown g\textexclamdown/i\textquestiondown\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown s\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} model parameters in relation to plant functional type (PFT), but instead only in relation to photosynthetic pathway. We constrained the key model parameter "\textexclamdown i\textquestiondown g\textexclamdown/i\textquestiondown\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown 1\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown ", which represents plant water use strategy, by PFT, based on a global synthesis of stomatal behaviour. As proof of concept, we also demonstrate that the \textexclamdown i\textquestiondown g\textexclamdown/i\textquestiondown\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown 1\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} parameter can be estimated using two long-term average (1960\textendash 1990) bioclimatic variables: (i) temperature and (ii) an indirect estimate of annual plant water availability. The new stomatal model, in conjunction with PFT parameterisations, resulted in a large reduction in annual fluxes of transpiration (\textasciitilde{} 30\% compared to the standard CABLE simulations) across evergreen needleleaf, tundra and C4 grass regions. Differences in other regions of the globe were typically small. Model performance against upscaled data products was not degraded, but did not noticeably reduce existing model\textendash data biases. We identified assumptions relating to the coupling of the vegetation to the atmosphere and the parameterisation of the minimum stomatal conductance as areas requiring further investigation in both CABLE and potentially other LSMs. We conclude that optimisation theory can yield a simple and tractable approach to predicting stomatal conductance in LSMs.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

  abstract = {Atmospheric aridity and drought both influence physiological function in plant leaves, but their relative contributions to changes in the ratio of leaf internal to ambient partial pressure of CO2 ({$\chi$}) \textendash{} an index of adjustments in both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate to environmental conditions \textendash{} are difficult to disentangle. Many stomatal models predicting {$\chi$} include the influence of only one of these drivers. In particular, the least-cost optimality hypothesis considers the effect of atmospheric demand for water on {$\chi$} but does not predict how soils with reduced water further influence {$\chi$}, potentially leading to an overestimation of {$\chi$} under dry conditions. Here, we use a large network of stable carbon isotope measurements in C3 woody plants to examine the acclimated response of {$\chi$} to soil water stress. We estimate the ratio of cost factors for carboxylation and transpiration ({$\beta$}) expected from the theory to explain the variance in the data, and investigate the responses of {$\beta$} (and thus {$\chi$}) to soil water content and suction across seed plant groups, leaf phenological types and regions. Overall, {$\beta$} decreases linearly with soil drying, implying that the cost of water transport along the soil\textendash plant\textendash atmosphere continuum increases as water available in the soil decreases. However, despite contrasting hydraulic strategies, the stomatal responses of angiosperms and gymnosperms to soil water tend to converge, consistent with the optimality theory. The prediction of {$\beta$} as a simple, empirical function of soil water significantly improves {$\chi$} predictions by up to 6.3 {$\pm$} 2.3\% (mean {$\pm$} SD of adjusted-R2) over 1980\textendash 2018 and results in a reduction of around 2\% of mean {$\chi$} values across the globe. Our results highlight the importance of soil water status on stomatal functions and plant water-use efficiency, and suggest the implementation of trait-based hydraulic functions into the model to account for soil water stress.},
