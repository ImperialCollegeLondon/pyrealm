# Module reference for `pmodel`

This page contains the detailed documentation of the functions and classes in the
`pyrealm.pmodel` module. The documentation describes the key equations used in each
member. In particular, note that the documentation of functions and methods includes two
lists of parameters:

* **Parameters**. These are the arguments in the function or class signature.
* **Other parameters**. These are the underlying parameters of the P model described in
  the [parameters](../params) documentation. These can be changed by the user but have a
  global effect rather than just altering a single function.

```{eval-rst}
.. automodule:: pyrealm.pmodel
    :autosummary:
    :members:
    :special-members: __init__

```
