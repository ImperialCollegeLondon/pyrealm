Here it is shown that the relationship between net and solar-radiation intensities depends on the degree of cloudiness and the ambient temperature. By making appropriate assumptions, a series of expressions for Qn is derived, with decreasing accuracy but increasing simplicity of estimation. It appears that clouds lower the net-radiation intensity when it exceeds a critical value in the region of 0.02 cal./cm2 min, but increase it when the intensity is lower.},

The elements are the eccentricity, the longitude of the perihelion, the processional parameter and the obliquity. This new formulary is much more simple to use than the ones previously designed and still provides excellent accuracy, mainly because it takes into account the influence of the most important higher order terms in the series expansions. The second part is devoted to the computation of the daily insolation both for calendar and solar dates.},

  abstract = {Solar irradiance received on a horizontal surface depends on the solar output, the semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit of the Earth around the sun (a), the distance from the Earth to the sun (r), and the zenith distance (z). The spectrum of the distance, r, for a given value of the true longitude, {$\lambda$}, displays mainly the precessional periods and, with much less power, half precession periods, eccentricity periods, and some combination tones. The zenith distance or its equivalent, the elevation angle (E), is only a function of obliquity ({$\epsilon$}) for a given latitude, {$\phi$}, true longitude, and hour angle, H. Therefore the insolation at a given constant value of z is only a function of precession and eccentricity. On the other hand, the value of the hour angle, H, corresponding to this fixed value of z varies with {$\varepsilon$}, except for the equinoxes, where H corresponding to a constant z also remains constant through time. Three kinds of insolation have been computed both analytically and numerically: the instantaneous insolation (irradiance) at noon, the daily irradiation, and the irradiations received during particular time intervals of the day defined by two constant values of the zenith distance (diurnal irradiations). Mean irradiances (irradiations divided by the length of the time interval over which they are calculated) are also computed for different time intervals, like the interval between sunrise and sunset, in particular. Examples of these insolations are given in this paper for the equinoxes and the solstices. At the equinoxes, for each latitude, all insolations are only a function of precession (this invalidates the results obtained by Cerveny [1991]). At the solstices, both precession and obliquity are present, although precession dominates for most of the latitudes. Because the lengths of the astronomical seasons are secularly variable (in terms of precession only), a particular calendar day does not always correspond to the same position relative to the sun through geological time. Similarly, a given longitude of the Sun on its orbit does not correspond to the same calendar day. For example, 103 kyr ago, assuming arbitrarily that the spring equinox is always on March 21, autumn began on September 13, and 114 kyr ago, it began on September 27, the length of the summer season being 85 and 98 calendar days, respectively, at these remote times in the past.},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessstrong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textbackslash}textgreaterAbstract.{\textbackslash}textless/strong{\textbackslash}textgreater The coupling between carbon uptake and water loss through stomata implies that gross primary production (GPP) can be limited by soil water availability through reduced leaf area and/or reduced stomatal conductance. Vegetation and land-surface models typically assume that GPP is highest under well-watered conditions and apply a stress function to reduce GPP with declining soil moisture below a critical threshold, which may be universal or prescribed by vegetation type. It is unclear how well current schemes represent the water conservation strategies of plants in different climates. Here eddy-covariance flux data are used to investigate empirically how soil moisture influences the light-use efficiency (LUE) of GPP. Well-watered GPP is estimated using the P model, a first-principles LUE model driven by atmospheric data and remotely sensed green vegetation cover. Breakpoint regression is used to relate the daily value of the ratio \&beta;(\&theta;) (flux-derived GPP/modelled well-watered GPP) to soil moisture, which is estimated using a generic water-balance model. Maximum LUE, even during wetter periods, is shown to decline with increasing climatic aridity index (AI). The critical soil-moisture threshold also declines with AI. Moreover, for any AI, there is a value of soil moisture at which \&beta;(\&theta;) is maximized, and this value declines with increasing AI. Thus, ecosystems adapted to seasonally dry conditions use water more conservatively (relative to well-watered ecosystems) when soil moisture is high, but maintain higher GPP when soil moisture is low. An empirical non-linear function of AI expressing these relationships is derived by non-linear regression, and used to generate a \&beta;(\&theta;) function that provides a multiplier for well-watered GPP as simulated by the P model. Substantially improved GPP simulation is shown during both unstressed and water-stressed conditions, compared to the reference model version that ignores soil-moisture stress, and to an earlier formulation in which maximum LUE was not reduced. This scheme may provide a step towards better-founded representations of carbon-water cycle coupling in vegetation and land-surface models.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

  abstract = {In big-leaf models of canopy photosynthesis, the Rubisco activity per unit ground area is taken as the sum of activities per unit leaf area within the canopy, and electron transport capacity is similarly summed. Such models overestimate rates of photosynthesis and require empirical curvature factors in the response to irradiance. We show that, with any distribution of leaf nitrogen within the canopy (including optimal), the required curvature factors are not constant but vary with canopy leaf area index and leaf nitrogen content. We further show that the underlying reason is the difference between the time-averaged and instantaneous distributions of absorbed irradiance, caused by penetration of sunflecks and the range of leaf angles in canopies. These errors are avoided in models that treat the canopy in terms of a number of layers -- the multi-layer models. We present an alternative to the multi-layer model: by separately integrating the sunlit and shaded leaf fractions of the canopy, a single layered sun/shade model is obtained, which is as accurate and simpler. The model is a scaled version of a leaf model as distinct from an integrative approach.}

	abstract = {Understanding biological temperature responses is crucial to predicting global carbon fluxes. The current approach to modelling temperature responses of photosynthetic capacity in large scale modelling efforts uses a modified Arrhenius equation. We rederived the modified Arrhenius equation from the source publication from 1942 and uncovered a missing term that was dropped by 2002. We compare fitted temperature response parameters between the correct and incorrect derivation of the modified Arrhenius equation. We find that most parameters are minimally affected, though activation energy is impacted quite substantially. We then scaled the impact of these small errors to whole plant carbon balance and found that the impact of the rederivation of the modified Arrhenius equation on modelled daily carbon gain causes a meaningful deviation of c. 18\% day−1. This suggests that the error in the derivation of the modified Arrhenius equation has impacted the accuracy of predictions of carbon fluxes at larger scales since {\textbackslash}textgreater 40\% of Earth System Models contain the erroneous derivation. We recommend that the derivation error be corrected in modelling efforts moving forward.},

Karst., Beaucarnea stricta Lem., Oplismenus hirtellus (L.) P. Beauv. and Poa annua L. Quantum yields were calculated from the initial slopes of the response of CO2 uptake to the quantity of photons absorbed in conditions of diffuse lighting. Regression analysis of variance of the initial slopes of the response of CO2 uptake to photon absorption failed to show any statistically significant differences between age classes within species or between the mature photosynthetic organs of different species. The constancy of ϕa,c was apparent despite marked variation in the light-saturated rates of CO2 uptake within and between species. The mean ϕa,c was 0.093±0.003 for 11 species. By contrast, surface absorptance varied markedly between species from 0.90 to 0.60, producing proportional variation in the quantum yield calculated on an incidentlight basis. The ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence emission at 695 nm for the same tissues also failed to show any statistically significant variation between species, with a mean of 0.838±0.008. Mean values of ϕa,c reported here for C3 species, in the absence of photorespiration, are higher than reported in previous surveys of vascular plants, but consistent with recent estimates of the quantum yields of O2 evolution.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods—random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression—as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10–fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base License.},

Many stomatal models predicting χ include the influence of only one of these drivers. In particular, the least-cost optimality hypothesis considers the effect of atmospheric demand for water on χ but does not predict how soils with reduced water further influence χ, potentially leading to an overestimation of χ under dry conditions. Here, we use a large network of stable carbon isotope measurements in C3 woody plants to examine the acclimated response of χ to soil water stress. We estimate the ratio of cost factors for carboxylation and transpiration (β) expected from the theory to explain the variance in the data, and investigate the responses of β (and thus χ) to soil water content and suction across seed plant groups, leaf phenological types and regions. Overall, β decreases linearly with soil drying, implying that the cost of water transport along the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum increases as water available in the soil decreases. However, despite contrasting hydraulic strategies, the stomatal responses of angiosperms and gymnosperms to soil water tend to converge, consistent with the optimality theory. The prediction of β as a simple, empirical function of soil water significantly improves χ predictions by up to 6.3 ± 2.3\% (mean ± SD of adjusted-R2) over 1980–2018 and results in a reduction of around 2\% of mean χ values across the globe. Our results highlight the importance of soil water status on stomatal functions and plant water-use efficiency, and suggest the implementation of trait-based hydraulic functions into the model to account for soil water stress.},

By making appropriate assumptions, a series of expressions for Qn is derived, with decreasing accuracy but increasing simplicity of estimation. It appears that clouds lower the net-radiation intensity when it exceeds a critical value in the region of 0.02 cal./cm2 min, but increase it when the intensity is lower.},

Karst., Beaucarnea stricta Lem., Oplismenus hirtellus (L.) P. Beauv. and Poa annua L. Quantum yields were calculated from the initial slopes of the response of CO2 uptake to the quantity of photons absorbed in conditions of diffuse lighting. Regression analysis of variance of the initial slopes of the response of CO2 uptake to photon absorption failed to show any statistically significant differences between age classes within species or between the mature photosynthetic organs of different species. The constancy of {$\phi$}a,c was apparent despite marked variation in the light-saturated rates of CO2 uptake within and between species. The mean {$\phi$}a,c was 0.093{\textpm}0.003 for 11 species. By contrast, surface absorptance varied markedly between species from 0.90 to 0.60, producing proportional variation in the quantum yield calculated on an incidentlight basis. The ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence emission at 695 nm for the same tissues also failed to show any statistically significant variation between species, with a mean of 0.838{\textpm}0.008. Mean values of {$\phi$}a,c reported here for C3 species, in the absence of photorespiration, are higher than reported in previous surveys of vascular plants, but consistent with recent estimates of the quantum yields of O2 evolution.},

	abstract = {Abstract Gross primary production (GPP) by terrestrial ecosystems is the largest flux in the global carbon cycle, and its continuing increase in response to environmental changes is key to land ecosystems’ capacity to offset anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. However, the CO 2 - and climate-sensitivities of GPP vary among models. We applied the ‘P model’—a parameter-sparse and extensively tested light use efficiency (LUE) model, driven by CO 2 , climate and remotely sensed greenness data—at 29 sites with multi-year eddy-covariance flux measurements. Observed (both positive and negative) GPP trends at these sites were predicted, albeit with some bias. Increasing LUE (due to rising atmospheric CO 2 concentration) and green vegetation cover were the primary controls of modelled GPP trends across sites. Global GPP simulated by the same model increased by 0.46 ± 0.09 Pg C yr –2 during 1982–2016. This increase falls in the mid-range rate of simulated increase by the TRENDY v8 ensemble of state-of-the-art ecosystem models. The modelled LUE increase during 1900–2013 was 15\%, similar to a published estimate based on deuterium isotopomers. Rising CO 2 was the largest contributor to the modelled GPP increase. Greening, which may in part be caused by rising CO 2 , ranked second but dominated the modelled GPP change over large areas, including semi-arid vegetation on all continents. Warming caused a small net reduction in modelled global GPP, but dominated the modelled GPP increase in high northern latitudes. These findings strengthen the evidence that rising LUE due to rising CO 2 level and increased green vegetation cover (fAPAR) are the main causes of increasing GPP, and thereby, the terrestrial carbon sink.},

	abstract = {In this “Grand Challenges” paper, we review how the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 has changed since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities and their inﬂuence on the natural carbon cycle, and we provide new estimates of possible future changes for a range of scenarios. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change reduce the ratio of 13C/12C in atmospheric CO2 (δ13CO2). This is because 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis and δ13C in plant‐derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and fossil fuels is lower than atmospheric δ13CO2. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion also reduce the ratio of 14C/C in atmospheric CO2 (Δ14CO2) because 14C is absent in million‐year‐old fossil fuels, which have been stored for much longer than the radioactive decay time of 14C. Atmospheric Δ14CO2 rapidly increased in the 1950s to 1960s because of 14C produced during nuclear bomb testing. The resulting trends in δ13C and Δ14C in atmospheric CO2 are inﬂuenced not only by these human emissions but also by natural carbon exchanges that mix carbon between the atmosphere and ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. This mixing caused Δ14CO2 to return toward preindustrial levels in the ﬁrst few decades after the spike from nuclear testing. More recently, as the bomb 14C excess is now mostly well mixed with the decadally overturning carbon reservoirs, fossil fuel emissions have become the main factor driving further decreases in atmospheric Δ14CO2. For δ13CO2, in addition to exchanges between reservoirs, the extent to which 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis appears to have increased, slowing down the recent δ13CO2 trend slightly. A new compilation of ice core and ﬂask δ13CO2 observations indicates that the decline in δ13CO2 since the preindustrial period is less than some prior estimates, which may have incorporated artifacts owing to offsets from different laboratories' measurements. Atmospheric observations of δ13CO2 have been used to investigate carbon ﬂuxes and the functioning of plants, and they are used for comparison with δ13C in other materials such as tree rings. Atmospheric observations of Δ14CO2 have been used to quantify the rate of air‐sea gas exchange and ocean circulation, and the rate of net primary production and the turnover time of carbon in plant material and soils. Atmospheric observations of Δ14CO2 are also used for comparison with Δ14C in other materials in many ﬁelds such as archaeology, forensics, and physiology. Another major application is the assessment of regional emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion using Δ14CO2 observations and models. In the future, δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 will continue to change. The sign and magnitude of the changes are mainly determined by global fossil fuel emissions. We present here simulations of future δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 for six scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Applications using atmospheric δ13CO2 and Δ14CO2 observations in carbon cycle science and many other ﬁelds will be affected by these future changes. We recommend an increased effort toward making coordinated measurements of δ13C and Δ14C across the Earth System and for further development of isotopic modeling and model‐data analysis tools.},

  abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term ({$\leq$}15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (               H               20               , height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (               {\^Z}               *, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing               {\^Z}               * showed that (               i               ) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (               ii               ) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (               Quercus rubra               ) and mesic (codominance by               Acer rubrum               and               Acer saccharum               ) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (               Thuja occidentalis               ) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g.,               Fraxinus nigra               ,               A. rubrum               ).},

	abstract = {Abstract The first part of this note provides all trigonometrical formulas which allow the direct spectral analysis and the computation of those long-term variations of the earth’s orbital elements which are of primary interest for the computation of the insolation. The elements are the eccentricity, the longitude of the perihelion, the processional parameter and the obliquity. This new formulary is much more simple to use than the ones previously designed and still provides excellent accuracy, mainly because it takes into account the influence of the most important higher order terms in the series expansions. The second part is devoted to the computation of the daily insolation both for calendar and solar dates.},
