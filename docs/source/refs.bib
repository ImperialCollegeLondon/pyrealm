  abstract = {Leaf dark respiration (Rdark ) is an important yet poorly quantified component of the global carbon cycle. Given this, we analyzed a new global database of Rdark and associated leaf traits. Data for 899 species were compiled from 100 sites (from the Arctic to the tropics). Several woody and nonwoody plant functional types (PFTs) were represented. Mixed-effects models were used to disentangle sources of variation in Rdark . Area-based Rdark at the prevailing average daily growth temperature (T) of each site increased only twofold from the Arctic to the tropics, despite a 20\textdegree C increase in growing T (8-28\textdegree C). By contrast, Rdark at a standard T (25\textdegree C, Rdark (25) ) was threefold higher in the Arctic than in the tropics, and twofold higher at arid than at mesic sites. Species and PFTs at cold sites exhibited higher Rdark (25) at a given photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax (25) ) or leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]) than species at warmer sites. Rdark (25) values at any given Vcmax (25) or [N] were higher in herbs than in woody plants. The results highlight variation in Rdark among species and across global gradients in T and aridity. In addition to their ecological significance, the results provide a framework for improving representation of Rdark in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) and associated land-surface components of Earth system models (ESMs).},

However, the CO               2               - and climate-sensitivities of GPP vary among models. We applied the `P model'\textemdash a parameter-sparse and extensively tested light use efficiency (LUE) model, driven by CO               2               , climate and remotely sensed greenness data\textemdash at 29 sites with multi-year eddy-covariance flux measurements. Observed (both positive and negative) GPP trends at these sites were predicted, albeit with some bias. Increasing LUE (due to rising atmospheric CO               2               concentration) and green vegetation cover were the primary controls of modelled GPP trends across sites. Global GPP simulated by the same model increased by 0.46 {$\pm$} 0.09 Pg C yr               \textendash 2               during 1982\textendash 2016. This increase falls in the mid-range rate of simulated increase by the TRENDY v8 ensemble of state-of-the-art ecosystem models. The modelled LUE increase during 1900\textendash 2013 was 15\%, similar to a published estimate based on deuterium isotopomers. Rising CO               2               was the largest contributor to the modelled GPP increase. Greening, which may in part be caused by rising CO               2               , ranked second but dominated the modelled GPP change over large areas, including semi-arid vegetation on all continents. Warming caused a small net reduction in modelled global GPP, but dominated the modelled GPP increase in high northern latitudes. These findings strengthen the evidence that rising LUE due to rising CO               2               level and increased green vegetation cover (fAPAR) are the main causes of increasing GPP, and thereby, the terrestrial carbon sink.},

We test an implementation of an optimal stomatal conductance model within the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) land surface model (LSM). In common with many LSMs, CABLE does not differentiate between \textexclamdown i\textquestiondown g\textexclamdown/i\textquestiondown\textexclamdown sub\textquestiondown s\textexclamdown/sub\textquestiondown{} model parameters in relation to plant functional type (PFT), but instead only in relation to photosynthetic pathway.

The new stomatal model, in conjunction with PFT parameterisations, resulted in a large reduction in annual fluxes of transpiration (\textasciitilde{} 30\% compared to the standard CABLE simulations) across evergreen needleleaf, tundra and C4 grass regions. Differences in other regions of the globe were typically small. Model performance against upscaled data products was not degraded, but did not noticeably reduce existing model\textendash data biases. We identified assumptions relating to the coupling of the vegetation to the atmosphere and the parameterisation of the minimum stomatal conductance as areas requiring further investigation in both CABLE and potentially other LSMs. We conclude that optimisation theory can yield a simple and tractable approach to predicting stomatal conductance in LSMs.\textexclamdown/p\textquestiondown},

The effects of dark respiration and photorespiration are also considered, and it is suggested that they have relatively little effect on discrimination other than cia their effects on intercellular p(COz). It is also suggested that various environmental factors such as light, temperature, salinity and drought will also have effects via changes in intercellular p(C0,).

  abstract = {In this ``Grand Challenges'' paper, we review how the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 has changed since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities and their influence on the natural carbon cycle, and we provide new estimates of possible future changes for a range of scenarios. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change reduce the ratio of 13C/12C in atmospheric CO2 ({$\delta$}13CO2). This is because 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis and {$\delta$}13C in plant-derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and fossil fuels is lower than atmospheric {$\delta$}13CO2. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion also reduce the ratio of 14C/C in atmospheric CO2 ({$\Delta$}14CO2) because 14C is absent in million-year-old fossil fuels, which have been stored for much longer than the radioactive decay time of 14C. Atmospheric {$\Delta$}14CO2 rapidly increased in the 1950s to 1960s because of 14C produced during nuclear bomb testing. The resulting trends in {$\delta$}13C and {$\Delta$}14C in atmospheric CO2 are influenced not only by these human emissions but also by natural carbon exchanges that mix carbon between the atmosphere and ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. This mixing caused {$\Delta$}14CO2 to return toward preindustrial levels in the first few decades after the spike from nuclear testing. More recently, as the bomb 14C excess is now mostly well mixed with the decadally overturning carbon reservoirs, fossil fuel emissions have become the main factor driving further decreases in atmospheric {$\Delta$}14CO2. For {$\delta$}13CO2, in addition to exchanges between reservoirs, the extent to which 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis appears to have increased, slowing down the recent {$\delta$}13CO2 trend slightly. A new compilation of ice core and flask {$\delta$}13CO2 observations indicates that the decline in {$\delta$}13CO2 since the preindustrial period is less than some prior estimates, which may have incorporated artifacts owing to offsets from different laboratories' measurements. Atmospheric observations of {$\delta$}13CO2 have been used to investigate carbon fluxes and the functioning of plants, and they are used for comparison with {$\delta$}13C in other materials such as tree rings. Atmospheric observations of {$\Delta$}14CO2 have been used to quantify the rate of air-sea gas exchange and ocean circulation, and the rate of net primary production and the turnover time of carbon in plant material and soils. Atmospheric observations of {$\Delta$}14CO2 are also used for comparison with {$\Delta$}14C in other materials in many fields such as archaeology, forensics, and physiology. Another major application is the assessment of regional emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion using {$\Delta$}14CO2 observations and models. In the future, {$\delta$}13CO2 and {$\Delta$}14CO2 will continue to change. The sign and magnitude of the changes are mainly determined by global fossil fuel emissions. We present here simulations of future {$\delta$}13CO2 and {$\Delta$}14CO2 for six scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Applications using atmospheric {$\delta$}13CO2 and {$\Delta$}14CO2 observations in carbon cycle science and many other fields will be affected by these future changes. We recommend an increased effort toward making coordinated measurements of {$\delta$}13C and {$\Delta$}14C across the Earth System and for further development of isotopic modeling and model-data analysis tools.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric aridity and drought both influence physiological function in plant leaves, but their relative contributions to changes in the ratio of leaf internal to ambient partial pressure of CO2 ({$\chi$}) \textendash{} an index of adjustments in both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate to environmental conditions \textendash{} are difficult to disentangle. Many stomatal models predicting {$\chi$} include the influence of only one of these drivers. In particular, the least-cost optimality hypothesis considers the effect of atmospheric demand for water on {$\chi$} but does not predict how soils with reduced water further influence {$\chi$}, potentially leading to an overestimation of {$\chi$} under dry conditions. Here, we use a large network of stable carbon isotope measurements in C3 woody plants to examine the acclimated response of {$\chi$} to soil water stress. We estimate the ratio of cost factors for carboxylation and transpiration ({$\beta$}) expected from the theory to explain the variance in the data, and investigate the responses of {$\beta$} (and thus {$\chi$}) to soil water content and suction across seed plant groups, leaf phenological types and regions. Overall, {$\beta$} decreases linearly with soil drying, implying that the cost of water transport along the soil\textendash plant\textendash atmosphere continuum increases as water available in the soil decreases. However, despite contrasting hydraulic strategies, the stomatal responses of angiosperms and gymnosperms to soil water tend to converge, consistent with the optimality theory. The prediction of {$\beta$} as a simple, empirical function of soil water significantly improves {$\chi$} predictions by up to 6.3 {$\pm$} 2.3\% (mean {$\pm$} SD of adjusted-R2) over 1980\textendash 2018 and results in a reduction of around 2\% of mean {$\chi$} values across the globe. Our results highlight the importance of soil water status on stomatal functions and plant water-use efficiency, and suggest the implementation of trait-based hydraulic functions into the model to account for soil water stress.},

  abstract = {Vegetation regulates land-atmosphere, water, and energy exchanges and is an essential component of land-surface models (LSMs). However, LSMs have been handicapped by assumptions that equate acclimated photosynthetic responses to the environment with the fast responses observable in the laboratory. The effects of acclimation can be taken into account by including PFT-specific values of photosynthetic parameters, but at the cost of increasing parameter requirements. Here, we develop an alternative approach for including acclimation in LSMs by adopting the P model, an existing light-use efficiency model for gross primary production (GPP) that implicitly predicts the acclimation of photosynthetic parameters on a weekly to monthly timescale via optimality principles. We demonstrate that it is possible to explicitly separate the fast and slow photosynthetic responses to environmental conditions, allowing the simulation of GPP at the sub-daily timesteps required for coupling in an LSM. The resulting model reproduces the diurnal cycles of GPP recorded by eddy-covariance flux towers in a temperate grassland and boreal, temperate and tropical forests. The best performance is achieved when biochemical capacities are adjusted to match recent midday conditions. Comparison between this model and the operational LSM in the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts climate model shows that the new model has better predictive power in most of the sites and years analyzed, particularly in summer and autumn. Our analyses suggest a simple and parameter-sparse method to include both instantaneous and acclimated responses within an LSM framework, with potential applications in weather, climate, and carbon-cycle modeling.},

Tuneable diode laser absorption spectroscopy provides new opportunities for making rapid, concurrent measurements of carbon isotope discrimination and CO2 assimilation over a range of environmental conditions, and this has facilitated the use of carbon isotope discrimination as a probe of C4 metabolism. In spite of the significant progress made in recent years, understanding how photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination measured concurrently with gas exchange relates to carbon isotope composition of leaf and plant dry matter remains a challenge that requires resolution if this technique is to be successfully applied as a screening tool in crop breeding and phylogenetic research. In this review, we update our understanding of the factors and assumptions that underlie variations in photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination in C4 leaves. Closing the main gaps in our understanding of carbon isotope discrimination during C4 photosynthesis may help advance research aimed at developing higher productivity and efficiency in key C4 food, feed, and biofuel crops.},
