  abstract = {Procedures and guidelines are recommended for assessing integrity, quality, and reasonableness of measured weather data and equipment calibration for automated and electronic agricultural weather stations. The procedures include calculation of hourly and 24-h clear sky envelopes for solar radiation, validation of net radiation measurements using calculation equations, and evaluation of expected trends and relationships between air vapor content and air temperature. The procedures for creating clear sky solar radiation envelopes include equations to account for the effects of atmospheric water vapor content and sun angle. Procedures for adjusting air temperature and air vapor content data are introduced to compensate for the aridity of the weather station environment. All of the guidelines are simple and straightforward, and can serve as preliminary ``filters'' by which to scrutinize weather measurements and as near real-time data flagging procedures for agricultural weather networks.}

  abstract = {Leaf dark respiration (Rdark ) is an important yet poorly quantified component of the global carbon cycle. Given this, we analyzed a new global database of Rdark and associated leaf traits. Data for 899 species were compiled from 100 sites (from the Arctic to the tropics). Several woody and nonwoody plant functional types (PFTs) were represented. Mixed-effects models were used to disentangle sources of variation in Rdark . Area-based Rdark at the prevailing average daily growth temperature (T) of each site increased only twofold from the Arctic to the tropics, despite a 20{$^\circ$}C increase in growing T (8-28{$^\circ$}C). By contrast, Rdark at a standard T (25{$^\circ$}C, Rdark (25) ) was threefold higher in the Arctic than in the tropics, and twofold higher at arid than at mesic sites. Species and PFTs at cold sites exhibited higher Rdark (25) at a given photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax (25) ) or leaf nitrogen concentration ([N]) than species at warmer sites. Rdark (25) values at any given Vcmax (25) or [N] were higher in herbs than in woody plants. The results highlight variation in Rdark among species and across global gradients in T and aridity. In addition to their ecological significance, the results provide a framework for improving representation of Rdark in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) and associated land-surface components of Earth system models (ESMs).},

  abstract = {Abstract Discrimination against 13C during photosynthesis is a well-characterised phenomenon. It leaves behind distinct signatures in organic matter of plants and in the atmosphere. The former is depleted in 13C, the latter is enriched during periods of preponderant photosynthetic activity of terrestrial ecosystems. The intra-annual cycle and latitudinal gradient in atmospheric 13C resulting from photosynthetic and respiratory activities of terrestrial plants have been exploited for the reconstruction of sources and sinks through deconvolution by inverse modelling. Here, we compile evidence for widespread post-photosynthetic fractionation that further modifies the isotopic signatures of individual plant organs and consequently leads to consistent differences in {$\delta$}13C between plant organs. Leaves were on average 0.96‰ and 1.91‰ more depleted than roots and woody stems, respectively. This phenomenon is relevant if the isotopic signature of CO2-exchange fluxes at the ecosystem level is used for the reconstruction of individual sources and sinks. It may also modify the parameterisation of inverse modelling approaches if it leads to different isotopic signatures of organic matter with different residence times within the ecosystems and to a respiratory contribution to the average difference between the isotopic composition of plant organic matter and the atmosphere. We discuss the main hypotheses that can explain the observed inter-organ differences in {$\delta$}13C. Copyright {\copyright} 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The elements are the eccentricity, the longitude of the perihelion, the processional parameter and the obliquity. This new formulary is much more simple to use than the ones previously designed and still provides excellent accuracy, mainly because it takes into account the influence of the most important higher order terms in the series expansions.

  abstract = {Solar irradiance received on a horizontal surface depends on the solar output, the semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit of the Earth around the sun (a), the distance from the Earth to the sun (r), and the zenith distance (z). The spectrum of the distance, r, for a given value of the true longitude, {$\lambda$}, displays mainly the precessional periods and, with much less power, half precession periods, eccentricity periods, and some combination tones. The zenith distance or its equivalent, the elevation angle (E), is only a function of obliquity ({$\epsilon$}) for a given latitude, {$\phi$}, true longitude, and hour angle, H. Therefore the insolation at a given constant value of z is only a function of precession and eccentricity. On the other hand, the value of the hour angle, H, corresponding to this fixed value of z varies with {$\varepsilon$}, except for the equinoxes, where H corresponding to a constant z also remains constant through time. Three kinds of insolation have been computed both analytically and numerically: the instantaneous insolation (irradiance) at noon, the daily irradiation, and the irradiations received during particular time intervals of the day defined by two constant values of the zenith distance (diurnal irradiations). Mean irradiances (irradiations divided by the length of the time interval over which they are calculated) are also computed for different time intervals, like the interval between sunrise and sunset, in particular. Examples of these insolations are given in this paper for the equinoxes and the solstices. At the equinoxes, for each latitude, all insolations are only a function of precession (this invalidates the results obtained by Cerveny [1991]). At the solstices, both precession and obliquity are present, although precession dominates for most of the latitudes. Because the lengths of the astronomical seasons are secularly variable (in terms of precession only), a particular calendar day does not always correspond to the same position relative to the sun through geological time. Similarly, a given longitude of the Sun on its orbit does not correspond to the same calendar day. For example, 103 kyr ago, assuming arbitrarily that the spring equinox is always on March 21, autumn began on September 13, and 114 kyr ago, it began on September 27, the length of the summer season being 85 and 98 calendar days, respectively, at these remote times in the past.},

However, the CO               2               - and climate-sensitivities of GPP vary among models. We applied the `P model'---a parameter-sparse and extensively tested light use efficiency (LUE) model, driven by CO               2               , climate and remotely sensed greenness data---at 29 sites with multi-year eddy-covariance flux measurements. Observed (both positive and negative) GPP trends at these sites were predicted, albeit with some bias. Increasing LUE (due to rising atmospheric CO               2               concentration) and green vegetation cover were the primary controls of modelled GPP trends across sites. Global GPP simulated by the same model increased by 0.46 {\textpm} 0.09 Pg C yr               --2               during 1982--2016. This increase falls in the mid-range rate of simulated increase by the TRENDY v8 ensemble of state-of-the-art ecosystem models. The modelled LUE increase during 1900--2013 was 15\%, similar to a published estimate based on deuterium isotopomers. Rising CO               2               was the largest contributor to the modelled GPP increase. Greening, which may in part be caused by rising CO               2               , ranked second but dominated the modelled GPP change over large areas, including semi-arid vegetation on all continents. Warming caused a small net reduction in modelled global GPP, but dominated the modelled GPP increase in high northern latitudes. These findings strengthen the evidence that rising LUE due to rising CO               2               level and increased green vegetation cover (fAPAR) are the main causes of increasing GPP, and thereby, the terrestrial carbon sink.},

The model described here simulates the dynamics of forest landscapes in a changing environment with simple phenomenological equations for tree growth processes and local environmental feedbacks. Tree establishment and growth rates are modified by species-specific functions describing the effects of winter and summer temperature limitations, accumulated annual foliage net assimilation and sapwood respiration as functions of temperature, CO2 fertilization, and growing-season drought. These functions provide external conditions for the simulation of patch-scale forest dynamics by a forest succession model, FORSKA, in which all of the trees on each 0.1 ha patch interact by competition for light and nutrients. The landscape is simulated as an array of such patches. The probability of disturbance on a patch is a power function of time since disturbance. Forest structure, composition and biomass simulated for the landscape average in boreal and temperate deciduous forests approach reasonable equilibrium values in 200--400 years. A climatic warning scenario is applied to central Sweden, where temperature and precipitation increases are shown to interact with each other and with soil water capacity in determining the transient and equilibrium responses of the forest landscape to climate change.},

Here we present a consolidated set of simple process-led algorithms for simulating habitats (SPLASH) allowing robust approximations of key quantities at ecologically relevant timescales. We specify equations, derivations, simplifications, and assumptions for the estimation of daily and monthly quantities of top-of-the-atmosphere solar radiation, net surface radiation, photosynthetic photon flux density, evapotranspiration (potential, equilibrium, and actual), condensation, soil moisture, and runoff, based on analysis of their relationship to fundamental climatic drivers. The climatic drivers include a minimum of three meteorological inputs: precipitation, air temperature, and fraction of bright sunshine hours. Indices, such as the moisture index, the climatic water deficit, and the Priestley--Taylor coefficient, are also defined. The SPLASH code is transcribed in C++, FORTRAN, Python, and R. A total of 1 year of results are presented at the local and global scales to exemplify the spatiotemporal patterns of daily and monthly model outputs along with comparisons to other model results.},

The new stomatal model, in conjunction with PFT parameterisations, resulted in a large reduction in annual fluxes of transpiration ({\textasciitilde} 30\% compared to the standard CABLE simulations) across evergreen needleleaf, tundra and C4 grass regions. Differences in other regions of the globe were typically small. Model performance against upscaled data products was not degraded, but did not noticeably reduce existing model--data biases. We identified assumptions relating to the coupling of the vegetation to the atmosphere and the parameterisation of the minimum stomatal conductance as areas requiring further investigation in both CABLE and potentially other LSMs. We conclude that optimisation theory can yield a simple and tractable approach to predicting stomatal conductance in LSMs.{\textexclamdown}/p{\textquestiondown}},

  abstract = {In big-leaf models of canopy photosynthesis, the Rubisco activity per unit ground area is taken as the sum of activities per unit leaf area within the canopy, and electron transport capacity is similarly summed. Such models overestimate rates of photosynthesis and require empirical curvature factors in the response to irradiance. We show that, with any distribution of leaf nitrogen within the canopy (including optimal), the required curvature factors are not constant but vary with canopy leaf area index and leaf nitrogen content. We further show that the underlying reason is the difference between the time-averaged and instantaneous distributions of absorbed irradiance, caused by penetration of sunflecks and the range of leaf angles in canopies. These errors are avoided in models that treat the canopy in terms of a number of layers -- the multi-layer models. We present an alternative to the multi-layer model: by separately integrating the sunlit and shaded leaf fractions of the canopy, a single layered sun/shade model is obtained, which is as accurate and simpler. The model is a scaled version of a leaf model as distinct from an integrative approach.}

The effects on discrimination by diffusion and carboxylation are integrated, yielding a simple relationship between discrimination and the ratio of the intercellular and atmospheric partial pressures of COZ. The effects of dark respiration and photorespiration are also considered, and it is suggested that they have relatively little effect on discrimination other than cia their effects on intercellular p(COz). It is also suggested that various environmental factors such as light, temperature, salinity and drought will also have effects via changes in intercellular p(C0,).

  abstract = {In this ``Grand Challenges'' paper, we review how the carbon isotopic composition of atmospheric CO2 has changed since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities and their influence on the natural carbon cycle, and we provide new estimates of possible future changes for a range of scenarios. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and land use change reduce the ratio of 13C/12C in atmospheric CO2 ({$\delta$}13CO2). This is because 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis and {$\delta$}13C in plant-derived carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and fossil fuels is lower than atmospheric {$\delta$}13CO2. Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion also reduce the ratio of 14C/C in atmospheric CO2 ({$\Delta$}14CO2) because 14C is absent in million-year-old fossil fuels, which have been stored for much longer than the radioactive decay time of 14C. Atmospheric {$\Delta$}14CO2 rapidly increased in the 1950s to 1960s because of 14C produced during nuclear bomb testing. The resulting trends in {$\delta$}13C and {$\Delta$}14C in atmospheric CO2 are influenced not only by these human emissions but also by natural carbon exchanges that mix carbon between the atmosphere and ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. This mixing caused {$\Delta$}14CO2 to return toward preindustrial levels in the first few decades after the spike from nuclear testing. More recently, as the bomb 14C excess is now mostly well mixed with the decadally overturning carbon reservoirs, fossil fuel emissions have become the main factor driving further decreases in atmospheric {$\Delta$}14CO2. For {$\delta$}13CO2, in addition to exchanges between reservoirs, the extent to which 12C is preferentially assimilated during photosynthesis appears to have increased, slowing down the recent {$\delta$}13CO2 trend slightly. A new compilation of ice core and flask {$\delta$}13CO2 observations indicates that the decline in {$\delta$}13CO2 since the preindustrial period is less than some prior estimates, which may have incorporated artifacts owing to offsets from different laboratories' measurements. Atmospheric observations of {$\delta$}13CO2 have been used to investigate carbon fluxes and the functioning of plants, and they are used for comparison with {$\delta$}13C in other materials such as tree rings. Atmospheric observations of {$\Delta$}14CO2 have been used to quantify the rate of air-sea gas exchange and ocean circulation, and the rate of net primary production and the turnover time of carbon in plant material and soils. Atmospheric observations of {$\Delta$}14CO2 are also used for comparison with {$\Delta$}14C in other materials in many fields such as archaeology, forensics, and physiology. Another major application is the assessment of regional emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion using {$\Delta$}14CO2 observations and models. In the future, {$\delta$}13CO2 and {$\Delta$}14CO2 will continue to change. The sign and magnitude of the changes are mainly determined by global fossil fuel emissions. We present here simulations of future {$\delta$}13CO2 and {$\Delta$}14CO2 for six scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) from the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Applications using atmospheric {$\delta$}13CO2 and {$\Delta$}14CO2 observations in carbon cycle science and many other fields will be affected by these future changes. We recommend an increased effort toward making coordinated measurements of {$\delta$}13C and {$\Delta$}14C across the Earth System and for further development of isotopic modeling and model-data analysis tools.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods---random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression---as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10--fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

PHS updates vegetation water stress and root water uptake to better reflect plant hydraulic theory, advancing the physical basis of the model. The new configuration introduces prognostic vegetation water potential, modeled at the root, stem, and leaf levels. Leaf water potential replaces soil potential as the basis for stomatal conductance water stress, and root water potential is used to implement hydraulic root water uptake, replacing a transpiration partitioning function. Point simulations of a tropical forest site (Caxiuan{\~a}, Brazil) under ambient conditions and partial precipitation exclusion highlight the differences between PHS and the previous CLM implementation. Model description and simulation results are contextualized with a list of benefits and limitations of the new model formulation, including hypotheses that were not testable in previous versions of the model. Key results include reductions in transpiration and soil moisture biases relative to a control model under both ambient and exclusion conditions, correcting excessive dry season soil moisture stress in the control model. PHS implements hydraulic gradient root water uptake, which allows hydraulic redistribution and compensatory root water uptake and results in PHS utilizing a larger portion of the soil column to buffer shortfalls in precipitation. The new model structure, which bases water stress on leaf water potential, could have significant implications for vegetation-climate feedbacks, including increased sensitivity of photosynthesis to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric aridity and drought both influence physiological function in plant leaves, but their relative contributions to changes in the ratio of leaf internal to ambient partial pressure of CO2 ({$\chi$}) -- an index of adjustments in both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate to environmental conditions -- are difficult to disentangle. Many stomatal models predicting {$\chi$} include the influence of only one of these drivers. In particular, the least-cost optimality hypothesis considers the effect of atmospheric demand for water on {$\chi$} but does not predict how soils with reduced water further influence {$\chi$}, potentially leading to an overestimation of {$\chi$} under dry conditions. Here, we use a large network of stable carbon isotope measurements in C3 woody plants to examine the acclimated response of {$\chi$} to soil water stress. We estimate the ratio of cost factors for carboxylation and transpiration ({$\beta$}) expected from the theory to explain the variance in the data, and investigate the responses of {$\beta$} (and thus {$\chi$}) to soil water content and suction across seed plant groups, leaf phenological types and regions. Overall, {$\beta$} decreases linearly with soil drying, implying that the cost of water transport along the soil--plant--atmosphere continuum increases as water available in the soil decreases. However, despite contrasting hydraulic strategies, the stomatal responses of angiosperms and gymnosperms to soil water tend to converge, consistent with the optimality theory. The prediction of {$\beta$} as a simple, empirical function of soil water significantly improves {$\chi$} predictions by up to 6.3 {\textpm} 2.3\% (mean {\textpm} SD of adjusted-R2) over 1980--2018 and results in a reduction of around 2\% of mean {$\chi$} values across the globe. Our results highlight the importance of soil water status on stomatal functions and plant water-use efficiency, and suggest the implementation of trait-based hydraulic functions into the model to account for soil water stress.},

By making appropriate assumptions, a series of expressions for Qn is derived, with decreasing accuracy but increasing simplicity of estimation. It appears that clouds lower the net-radiation intensity when it exceeds a critical value in the region of 0.02 cal./cm2 min, but increase it when the intensity is lower.},

Quantum yields were calculated from the initial slopes of the response of CO2 uptake to the quantity of photons absorbed in conditions of diffuse lighting. Regression analysis of variance of the initial slopes of the response of CO2 uptake to photon absorption failed to show any statistically significant differences between age classes within species or between the mature photosynthetic organs of different species. The constancy of {$\phi$}a,c was apparent despite marked variation in the light-saturated rates of CO2 uptake within and between species. The mean {$\phi$}a,c was 0.093{\textpm}0.003 for 11 species. By contrast, surface absorptance varied markedly between species from 0.90 to 0.60, producing proportional variation in the quantum yield calculated on an incidentlight basis. The ratio of variable to maximum fluorescence emission at 695 nm for the same tissues also failed to show any statistically significant variation between species, with a mean of 0.838{\textpm}0.008. Mean values of {$\phi$}a,c reported here for C3 species, in the absence of photorespiration, are higher than reported in previous surveys of vascular plants, but consistent with recent estimates of the quantum yields of O2 evolution.},

  abstract = {Vegetation regulates land-atmosphere, water, and energy exchanges and is an essential component of land-surface models (LSMs). However, LSMs have been handicapped by assumptions that equate acclimated photosynthetic responses to the environment with the fast responses observable in the laboratory. The effects of acclimation can be taken into account by including PFT-specific values of photosynthetic parameters, but at the cost of increasing parameter requirements. Here, we develop an alternative approach for including acclimation in LSMs by adopting the P model, an existing light-use efficiency model for gross primary production (GPP) that implicitly predicts the acclimation of photosynthetic parameters on a weekly to monthly timescale via optimality principles. We demonstrate that it is possible to explicitly separate the fast and slow photosynthetic responses to environmental conditions, allowing the simulation of GPP at the sub-daily timesteps required for coupling in an LSM. The resulting model reproduces the diurnal cycles of GPP recorded by eddy-covariance flux towers in a temperate grassland and boreal, temperate and tropical forests. The best performance is achieved when biochemical capacities are adjusted to match recent midday conditions. Comparison between this model and the operational LSM in the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts climate model shows that the new model has better predictive power in most of the sites and years analyzed, particularly in summer and autumn. Our analyses suggest a simple and parameter-sparse method to include both instantaneous and acclimated responses within an LSM framework, with potential applications in weather, climate, and carbon-cycle modeling.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The coupling between carbon uptake and water loss through stomata implies that gross primary production (GPP) can be limited by soil water availability through reduced leaf area and/or reduced stomatal conductance. Vegetation and land-surface models typically assume that GPP is highest under well-watered conditions and apply a stress function to reduce GPP with declining soil moisture below a critical threshold, which may be universal or prescribed by vegetation type. It is unclear how well current schemes represent the water conservation strategies of plants in different climates. Here eddy-covariance flux data are used to investigate empirically how soil moisture influences the light-use efficiency (LUE) of GPP. Well-watered GPP is estimated using the P model, a first-principles LUE model driven by atmospheric data and remotely sensed green vegetation cover. Breakpoint regression is used to relate the daily value of the ratio \&beta;(\&theta;) (flux-derived GPP/modelled well-watered GPP) to soil moisture, which is estimated using a generic water-balance model. Maximum LUE, even during wetter periods, is shown to decline with increasing climatic aridity index (AI). The critical soil-moisture threshold also declines with AI. Moreover, for any AI, there is a value of soil moisture at which \&beta;(\&theta;) is maximized, and this value declines with increasing AI. Thus, ecosystems adapted to seasonally dry conditions use water more conservatively (relative to well-watered ecosystems) when soil moisture is high, but maintain higher GPP when soil moisture is low. An empirical non-linear function of AI expressing these relationships is derived by non-linear regression, and used to generate a \&beta;(\&theta;) function that provides a multiplier for well-watered GPP as simulated by the P model. Substantially improved GPP simulation is shown during both unstressed and water-stressed conditions, compared to the reference model version that ignores soil-moisture stress, and to an earlier formulation in which maximum LUE was not reduced. This scheme may provide a step towards better-founded representations of carbon-water cycle coupling in vegetation and land-surface models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The current approach to modelling temperature responses of photosynthetic capacity in large scale modelling efforts uses a modified Arrhenius equation. We rederived the modified Arrhenius equation from the source publication from 1942 and uncovered a missing term that was dropped by 2002. We compare fitted temperature response parameters between the correct and incorrect derivation of the modified Arrhenius equation. We find that most parameters are minimally affected, though activation energy is impacted quite substantially. We then scaled the impact of these small errors to whole plant carbon balance and found that the impact of the rederivation of the modified Arrhenius equation on modelled daily carbon gain causes a meaningful deviation of c. 18\% day-1. This suggests that the error in the derivation of the modified Arrhenius equation has impacted the accuracy of predictions of carbon fluxes at larger scales since {$>$} 40\% of Earth System Models contain the erroneous derivation. We recommend that the derivation error be corrected in modelling efforts moving forward.},

  abstract = {The perfect-plasticity approximation (PPA) is an analytically tractable model of forest dynamics, defined in terms of parameters for individual trees, including allometry, growth, and mortality. We estimated these parameters for the eight most common species on each of four soil types in the US Lake states (Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) by using short-term ({$\leq$}15-year) inventory data from individual trees. We implemented 100-year PPA simulations given these parameters and compared these predictions to chronosequences of stand development. Predictions for the timing and magnitude of basal area dynamics and ecological succession on each soil were accurate, and predictions for the diameter distribution of 100-year-old stands were correct in form and slope. For a given species, the PPA provides analytical metrics for early-successional performance (               H               20               , height of a 20-year-old open-grown tree) and late-successional performance (               {\^Z}               *, equilibrium canopy height in monoculture). These metrics predicted which species were early or late successional on each soil type. Decomposing               {\^Z}               * showed that (               i               ) succession is driven both by superior understory performance and superior canopy performance of late-successional species, and (               ii               ) performance differences primarily reflect differences in mortality rather than growth. The predicted late-successional dominants matched chronosequences on xeromesic (               Quercus rubra               ) and mesic (codominance by               Acer rubrum               and               Acer saccharum               ) soil. On hydromesic and hydric soils, the literature reports that the current dominant species in old stands (               Thuja occidentalis               ) is now failing to regenerate. Consistent with this, the PPA predicted that, on these soils, stands are now succeeding to dominance by other late-successional species (e.g.,               Fraxinus nigra               ,               A. rubrum               ).},

However, soil moisture limitation is known to strongly affect plant physiology. Here, we investigate light use efficiency, the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to absorbed light. We derive its fractional reduction due to soil moisture (fLUE), separated from VPD and greenness changes, using artificial neural networks trained {\dots}},

  abstract = {The aim of the present investigation is evaluation of the thermophysical and transport properties of moist air as a function of mixture temperature with relative humidity as a parameter, ranging between dry air and saturation conditions. Based on a literature review of the most widely available analytical procedures and methods, a number of developed correlations are presented, which are employed with recent gas mixture component properties as input parameters, to derive the temperature and humidity dependence of mixture density, viscosity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and Prandtl number under conditions corresponding to the total barometric pressure of 101.3kPa. The derived results at an accuracy level suitable for engineering calculations were plotted and compared with adequate accuracy with existing results from previous analytical calculations and measured data from earlier experimental investigations. The saturated mixture properties were also appropriately fitted, and the fitting expressions suitable for computer calculations are also presented.},

  abstract = {Photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination is a non-destructive tool for investigating C4 metabolism. Tuneable diode laser absorption spectroscopy provides new opportunities for making rapid, concurrent measurements of carbon isotope discrimination and CO2 assimilation over a range of environmental conditions, and this has facilitated the use of carbon isotope discrimination as a probe of C4 metabolism. In spite of the significant progress made in recent years, understanding how photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination measured concurrently with gas exchange relates to carbon isotope composition of leaf and plant dry matter remains a challenge that requires resolution if this technique is to be successfully applied as a screening tool in crop breeding and phylogenetic research. In this review, we update our understanding of the factors and assumptions that underlie variations in photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination in C4 leaves. Closing the main gaps in our understanding of carbon isotope discrimination during C4 photosynthesis may help advance research aimed at developing higher productivity and efficiency in key C4 food, feed, and biofuel crops.},
