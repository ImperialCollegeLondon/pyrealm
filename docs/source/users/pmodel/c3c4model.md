# C3 / C4 Competition

Compared to C3 plants, plants using the C4 photosynthetic pathway:

* cope well in arid areas, operating with lower stomatal conductance and lower leaf
  internal CO2 than C3 plants,
* are strongly favoured in lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and
* do not experience significant photorespiration costs.

This gives C4 plants a substantial competitive advantage in warm, dry and low CO2
environments. The {class}`~pyrealm.pmodel.competition.C3C4Competition` class provides an
implementation of a model {cite:p}`lavergne:2022a` that estimates the expected fraction
of GPP from C4 plants. It uses predictions of GPP from the
{class}`~pyrealm.pmodel.pmodel.PModel` assuming communities consisting solely of C3 or
C4 plants to calculate the expected fraction of C4 plants in the community and the
contributions to GPP from C3 and C4 plants at each site.

## Step 1: Proportional GPP advantage

The first step is to calculate the proportional advantage in gross primary productivity
(GPP) of C4 over C3 plants ($A_4$) in the study locations.

## Step 2: Convert GPP advantage to the fraction of C4 plants

A statistical model is then used to convert the proportional C4 GPP advantage to the
expected C4 fraction ($F_4$) in a community (see
{class}`~pyrealm.pmodel.competition.C3C4Competition` for details). This model includes a
correction term for the estimated percentage tree cover and the plot below shows how
$F_4$ changes with $A_4$, given differing estimates of tree cover.

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot
from matplotlib.lines import Line2D

from pyrealm.pmodel import (
    PModel,
    PModelEnvironment,
    CalcCarbonIsotopes,
    C3C4Competition,
    convert_gpp_advantage_to_c4_fraction,
    calculate_tree_proportion,
)

# Generate 2D arrays for combinations of GPP advantage and tree cover
gpp_adv_c4_1d = (np.linspace(-1, 1, 201),)
treecover_1d = np.array([0, 1, 2, 100])
gpp_adv_c4_2d, treecover_2d = np.meshgrid(gpp_adv_c4_1d, treecover_1d)

# Get the conversion
frac_c4 = convert_gpp_advantage_to_c4_fraction(gpp_adv_c4_2d, treecover_2d)

# Plot the results
for idx, lev in enumerate(treecover_1d):
    pyplot.plot(gpp_adv_c4_2d[idx, :], frac_c4[idx, :], label=f"{int(lev)}%")

pyplot.legend(title="Forest cover", frameon=False)
pyplot.title(r"Initial C4 fraction prediction from $A_4$ and tree cover")
pyplot.xlabel("Proportion C4 GPP advantage $A_4$")
pyplot.ylabel("Expected C4 fraction ($F_4$)")
pyplot.axvline(0, ls="--", c="grey")
```

## Step 3: Account for shading by C3 trees

The fraction of C4 plants can be reduced below expectations simply from relative GPP
advantage by shading from C3 trees. A statistical model is used to predict the
proportion of GPP expected from C3 trees ($h$) and this is used to discount $F_4 = F_4
(1-h)$.

The plot below shows how $h$ varies with the expected GPP from C3 plants alone. The
dashed line shows the C3 GPP estimate above which canopy closure leads to complete
shading of C4 plants.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

# Just use the competition model to predict h across a GPP gradient
gpp_c3_kg = np.linspace(0, 5, 101)
prop_trees = calculate_tree_proportion(gpp_c3_kg)
pyplot.plot(gpp_c3_kg, prop_trees)
pyplot.axvline(2.8, ls="--", c="grey")

pyplot.title("Proportion of GPP from C3 trees")
pyplot.xlabel("GPP from C3 plants (kg m-2 yr-1)")
pyplot.ylabel("Proportion of GPP from C3 trees (h, -)")
```

## Step 4: Filtering cold areas and cropland

The last steps are to set $F_4 = 0$ for locations where the mean temperature of the
coldest month is below a threshold for the persistence of C4 plants (`below_t_min`) and
then to remove predictions for croplands (`cropland`), where the C4 fraction is driven
by agricultural management.

## Predicted GPP and expected isotopic signatures

The resulting model predicts the fraction of GPP from C4 and hence the actual
contributions to total GPP from the C3 and C4 pathways. In addition, the model can be
used to generate the expected isotopic signatures resulting from the predicted fractions
of C3 and C4 plants.

## Worked example

The code below shows the various stages of the model for example annual GPP predictions
for C3 plants and C4 plants alone across a temperature gradient with an estimated tree
cover of 0.5.

### Code

```{code-cell}
# Use a simple temperature sequence to generate a range of optimal chi values
n_pts = 51
tc_1d = np.linspace(-10, 45, n_pts)
ppfd = 450
fapar = 0.9

# Fit C3 and C4 P models
env = PModelEnvironment(tc=tc_1d, patm=101325, co2=400, vpd=1000)

mod_c3 = PModel(env, method_optchi="prentice14")
mod_c3.estimate_productivity(fapar=fapar, ppfd=ppfd)

mod_c4 = PModel(env, method_optchi="c4")
mod_c4.estimate_productivity(fapar=fapar, ppfd=ppfd)

# Competition, using annual GPP from µgC m2 s to g m2 yr
gpp_c3_annual = mod_c3.gpp * (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) * 1e-6
gpp_c4_annual = mod_c4.gpp * (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) * 1e-6

# Fit the competition model
comp = C3C4Competition(
    gpp_c3=gpp_c3_annual,
    gpp_c4=gpp_c4_annual,
    treecover=0.5,
    below_t_min=False,
    cropland=False,
)

# Calculate step by step components of model
frac_c4_step2 = convert_gpp_advantage_to_c4_fraction(comp.gpp_adv_c4, 0.5)
prop_trees = calculate_tree_proportion(gppc3=gpp_c3_annual / 1000)
frac_c4_step3 = frac_c4_step2 * (1 - prop_trees)

# Generate isotopic predictions
isotope_c3 = CalcCarbonIsotopes(mod_c3, d13CO2=-8.4, D14CO2=19.2)
isotope_c4 = CalcCarbonIsotopes(mod_c4, d13CO2=-8.4, D14CO2=19.2)

comp.estimate_isotopic_discrimination(
    d13CO2=-8.4,
    Delta13C_C3_alone=isotope_c3.Delta13C,
    Delta13C_C4_alone=isotope_c4.Delta13C,
)

comp.summarize()
```

### Figures

The plots below then show the various stages of the model prediction.

Panel A
: GPP predictions from the P model across a temperature gradient for C3 or C4 plants
  alone. The horizontal dashed line shows the canopy closure threshold for C3 plants
  (see Step 3).

Panel B
: The relative GPP advantage of C4 over C3 photosynthesis across the temperature
  gradient.

Panel C
: The proportion of GPP from C3 trees across the temperature gradient. Between roughly
  5°C and 30°C, canopy closure is predicted to exclude C4 plants, even where they have a
  GPP advantage (Panel B, > 22°C).

Panel D
: Predicted $F_4$ across the temperature gradient, showing the prediction purely from
  relative advantage and treecover (Step 2) and then accounting for the impact of C3
  tree canopy closure (Step 3),

Panel E
: The predicted contributions of plants using the C3 and C4 pathways to the total
  expected GPP

Panel F
: The contributions of plants using the C3 and C4 pathways to predicted
  $\delta\ce{^{13}C}$ .
