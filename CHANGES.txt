0.1.0 - First release of pyrealm. Implementation of P model
0.1.1 - (aka hotfix/bad_setup). Fixing problems in setup.py
0.1.2 - Fixing problems with setup for PyPi publication.
0.1.3 - Clipping negative values in calc_ftemp_kphio
0.1.4 - Rescaled ftemp_kphio to remove double division error
      - Disabled C4 pytests while rpmodel retains this issue.
0.2.0 - Implementation of the T model
0.3.0 - Refactor of parameter classes into param_classes module with
        consistent ParamClass baseclass for import/export and dataclass
        based interface.
0.3.1 - Restructure of requirements and install_requires for better pip install
0.4.0 - Refactor of the PModel to separate calc of gammastar etc, from
        the pmodel itself: PModelEnvironment and PModel classes.
      - Implementation of ConstrainedArray class to clip inputs to
        biologically meaningful ranges and to identify that clipping
        has occurred. Particular issue with serious numerical instability
        in calc_density_h2o, but now adopted a general solution to clipping
        inputs.
      - Expansion of PModel testing to include a global array giving a wider
        range of inputs including edge cases.
      - Created option for using a rootzonestress option (Rodolfo Nobrega)
0.5.0 - Refactor of constrained_array modules to use a class factory that
        acts as both a constraint and a check on existing constraint types.
      - Implementation of the utilities module, currently including some
        hygrometric conversions and shared utility functions.
      - Refactor of PModel and Iabs scaling
      - Better __repr__ and new summarize() functions in pmodel module.
0.5.1 - Minor tweaks to utilities param classes
      - Backtrack on constrained_arrays - unexpected issues with chained use.
        Currently just turning off a single constraint.
0.5.2 - Fix for critical bug in mj calculation - using masked arrays is fragile, need
        to consider this - and the constraint approach which generates masked
        inputs.
0.5.3 - Replaced ConstrainedArray and masked arrays with input_bounds_checker
        and 'masking' using np.nan. See notes in pyrealm/bounds_checker.py. This
        was revisited even before release to remove built in masking completely
        and just provide some warnings on sane ranges. A hard limit for temps
        < 25°C is imposed due to the behaviour of calc_density_h2o.
0.5.4 - Updated CalcOptimalChi to return an actual estimate of chi for C4 
        plants, not just 1.0. Updated documentation and examples to illustrate.
0.5.5 - Fixing the calculation of stomatal conductance for C4 plants - not infinite
      - Added estimate_productivity.md in docs to show behaviour of those
        variables for C3 and C4 - revealed some issues!
0.5.6 - Bugs in calculation of Jmax and g_s fixed.
      - Fixed issue with utilities.summarize_attr with masked arrays containing
        all NaN values
0.6.0 - Breaking change to inputs to CalcOptimalChi - now uses PModelEnvironment
        object, not named args for kmm etc.
      - PModel testing update: new set of input test values of 100 values across
        envt space, not just 4 arbitrary values. Updated R outputs.
      - Restructure of test_pmodel - much cleaner use of parameterisations args.
      - Addition of units to utilities.summarize_attr and extensive addition
        of units throughout docs.
      - Bug in Jmax calculation - not carrying ftemp_kphio correctly into calculation -
        corrected by baking ftemp_kphio correction to kphio early.
      - Breaking change to calculation of Jmax and Vcmax. Previous versions 
        followed rpmodel in using a more complex calculation for Jmax and 
        Vcmax that allowed Stocker's empirical soil moisture effects (beta(theta))
        to be worked back into Vcmax then Jmax, rd and gs. pyrealm no longer does 
        this: the soil moisture correction is applied _only_ to LUE and the getter
        function for vcmax, jmax, gs and rd issue a warning that they are 
        uncorrected when soil moisture effects are applied.
      - Internal changes - the CalcLUEVcmax class has been retired. This structuring
        was integral to the soil moisture correction approach, but with that 
        change, a simple JmaxLimitation class replaces it.
      - Flexibility in the units of PPFD - previous versions were agnostic about
        the units of PPFD - so that the scaling of GPP could be set by the user.
        However, that leads to nonsensical values of Jmax and Vcmax, which must
        be in µmol m-2 s-1. So, PPFD now must also be in µmol m-2 s-1.
