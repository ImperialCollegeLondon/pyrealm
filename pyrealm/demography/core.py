"""Core shared functionality for the {mod}`~pyrealm.demography` module.

This module implements two abstract base classes that are used to share core methods
across demography classes:

* {class}`~pyrealm.demography.core.PandasExporter` provides the utility
  {meth}`~pyrealm.demography.core.PandasExporter.to_pandas` method for extracting data
  from demography classes for plotting and exploring data.
* {class}`~pyrealm.demography.core.CohortMethods` provides the utility
  {meth}`~pyrealm.demography.core.CohortMethods.add_cohort_data` and
  {meth}`~pyrealm.demography.core.CohortMethods.drop_cohort_data` methods that are used
  to append new cohort data across some demography dataclasses.

    """Shared validation for demography inputs.

    Trait arguments of functions should always be 1 dimensional arrays (row arrays) or
    arrays of size 1 ('scalar'), representing trait values that are constant within a
    cohort or stem. If multiple traits are being validated, then they should all have
    have the same shape or be scalar.

    In addition to simple validation of trait inputs, many demographic functions make
    predictions of stem allometries, allocation and crown profile at a range of sizes.
    These size arguments provide values at which to estimate predictions across stems
    with different traits and  could represent different stem sizes (e.g. dbh) or
    different stem heights at which to evaluate crown profiles. If size arguments are
    provided, then they are also validated. All size arguments must have the same shape
    or be scalar. Given that the stem traits provide N values, the shape of the size
    arguments can then be:

    * A scalar array (i.e. with size 1, such as np.array(1) or np.array([1])), that
      provides a single size at which to calculate predictions for all N stems.
    * A one dimensional array with identical shape to the stem properties (``(N,)``)
      that provides individual single values for each stem.
    * A two dimensional column vector (i.e. with shape ``(M, 1)``) that provides a set
      of ``M`` values at which to calculate multiple predictions for all stem traits.
    * A two-dimensional array ``(M, N)`` that provides individual predictions for each
      stem.

    Lastly, some functions generate predictions for stems at a particular size, given a
    third input. For example, the stem allocation process evaluates how potential GPP is
    allocated for a stem of a given size. (TBD - add crown example). If provided, these
    ``at_size_args`` values are validated as follows:

    * if ``z`` is a row array, ``q_z`` must then have identical shape, or
    * if ``z`` is a column array ``(N, 1)``, ``q_z`` must then have shape ``(N,
        n_stem_properties``).

    Args:
        trait_args: A dictionary of row arrays representing trait values, keyed by the
            trait names.
        size_args: A dictionary of arrays representing size values for stem allometry or
            canopy height at which to evaluate functions, keyed by the value name.
        at_size_args: A dictionary of arrays providing values that are to be evaluated
            given predictions for a set of traits at a given size and which must be
            congruent with both trait and size arguments. The dictionary should be keyed
            with the value name.
