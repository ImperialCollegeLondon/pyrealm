    This function takes the number of individuals in each cohort along with the stem
    height and crown area and a given vertical height (:math:`z`). It then uses the
    crown shape parameters associated with each cohort to calculate the community wide
    projected crown area above that height (:math:`A_p(z)`). This is simply the sum of
    the products of the individual stem crown projected area at :math:`z` and the number
    of individuals in each cohort.

    The return value is the difference between the calculated :math:`A_p(z)` and a
    user-specified target area, This allows the function to be used with a root solver
    to find :math:`z` values that result in a given :math:`A_p(z)`. The default target
    area is zero, so the default return value will be the actual total :math:`A_p(z)`
    for the community.

    A typical use case for the target area would be to specify the area at which a given
    canopy layer closes under the perfect plasticity approximation in order to find the
    closure height.

    The cohort canopy data consists of a set of attributes represented as two

    properties of individuals within cohorts.

    The data class:

    1. Takes the projected leaf area at the required heights and then partitions this
       into the actual leaf area within each layer, the leaf area index across the whole
       cohort and then then light absorption and transmission fractions of each cohort
       at each level.

    2. Calculates the community-wide transmission and absorption profiles. These are
       generated as an instance of the class
       :class:`~pyrealm.demography.canopy.CommunityCanopyData` and stored in the
       ``community_data`` attribute.

    3. Allocates the community-wide absorption across cohorts. The total fraction of
       light absorbed across layers is a community-wide property
       - each cohort contributes to the cumulative light absorption. Once the light
       absorbed within a layer of the community is known, this can then be partitioned

            functional type of each cohort.
