"""Tools to identify a growing season within annual cycles.

The growing season is identified as a number of days during which plants consistently
experience conditions above certain thresholds. A commonly used condition is days where
the temperature is greater than 0Â°C but any set of conditions could be used to generate
a binary sequence showing whether a day is suitable for growth or not.

The next step is then to address the issue of 'consistently' suitable for growth. This
module provides filters that can be used to remove short runs of days with unsuitable
conditions within a growing season and lead to more stable definitions of growing season
for a location.

    Incomplete implementation - the aim here is to use strides to apply a filter across
    all axes simultaneously. The basic idea is to use as_strided to wrap an input array

        [1,2,3,4,5,6]

        [[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[3,4,5],[4,5,6]]

    That allows logical tests along that new axis to check if at least one day within a
    window has growing conditions and hence allow short runs to be identified. The basic
    structure is there, but it is tricky to finesse the details. The second version
    below is much easier to implement and so is an easier place to start - but it is
    likely to be much less efficient.
