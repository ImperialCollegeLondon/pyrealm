"""Many of the functions and classes in `pyrealm` have an underlying set of
parameters that will typically be held constant. This includes true universal constants,
such as the molar mass of Carbon, but also a large number of calculated parameters from
the literature.

These underlying parameters are not hardcoded, but rather dataclasses for constants  are
defined for different models within `pyrealm`. The defaults in these dataclasses can be
altered and can also be loaded and saved to configuration files. The
:class:`~pyrealm.constants.base.ConstantsClass` base class provides the basic load and
save methods and then individual subclasses define the constants and default values for
each class.

This implementation has the following desired features:

1. Ability to use a obj.attr notation rather than obj['attr'].
2. Ability to freeze values to avoid them being edited in use - distinctly paranoid!
3. Ability to set a default mapping with default values.
4. Typing to set expected types on default values.
5. Simple export/import methods to go to from dict / JSON.
6. Is a class, to allow __repr__ and other methods.

    This base class provides a consistent interface for creating and exporting data from
    model constant classes. It defines methods to create instances from a dictionary of
    values and from a JSON file of values. It also defines methods to export an existing
    instance of a constants class to a dictionary or a JSON file.

    All model constant classes use the :func:`~dataclasses.dataclass` decorator as the
    basic structure. All fields in these classes are defined with default values, so
    instances can be defined using partial dictionaries of alternative values.
