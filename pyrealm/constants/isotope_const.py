    This data class provides values for underlying constants used in the calculation of
    carbon isotope discrimination from P Model instances.

    * For C4 plants, the coefficients for calculating isotopic discrimination are taken
      from :cite:t:`lavergne:2022a`. The class also provides an alternative, but
      currently implemented, parameterisation using coefficients taken from
      :cite:t:`voncaemmerer:2014a`.
    * For C3 plants, the coefficients for calculating isotopic discrimination are taken
      from :cite:t:`farquhar:1982a`.
    * Post-photosynthetic fractionation values are also provided between leaf organic
      matter and alpha-cellulose :cite:p:`frank:2015a` and bulk wood
      :cite:p:`badeck:2005a`.
