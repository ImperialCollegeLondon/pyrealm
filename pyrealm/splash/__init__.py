"""The splash submodule implements the SPLASH model for calculating robust indices of
radiation, evapotranspiration and plant-available moisture.

It is based on the SPLASH v1.0 implementation but has been extensively refactored and
restructured to make the functionality part of an installable package and to enable
array inputs in calculations.
