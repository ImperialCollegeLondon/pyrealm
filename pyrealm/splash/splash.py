class SplashModel:
    r"""Fitting the SPLASH model.

    The SplashModel class calculates the predictions of the SPLASH v1.0 model
    :cite:p:`davis:2017a`. The input variables of latitude, elevation, temperature,
    precipitation and sunshine fraction of observations are initially used to calculate
    solar and evaporative fluxes, which are stored in the ``solar`` and ``evap``
    attributes as instances of :class:`~pyrealm.splash.solar.DailySolarFluxes` and
    :class:`~pyrealm.splash.evap.DailyEvapFluxes`.

    The inputs to a SplashModel are expected to be numpy arrays with time varying along
    the first dimension. Other dimensions represent observations at sites on a
    particular date.  The ``dates`` argument is expected to be a Calendar object with
    the same length as the first dimension.

    The main use of the SplashModel object is then to calculate the expected actual
    evapotranspiration (AET), soil moisture and runoff across the time series:

    * The :meth:`~pyrealm.splash.splash.SplashModel.calculate_soil_moisture` returns
      these calculations, given an initial estimate of soil moisture in observed sites.
      This method simply iterates over the days, applying the
      :meth:`~pyrealm.splash.splash.SplashModel.estimate_daily_water_balance` method to
      calculate the daily water balance, given the soil moisture of the preceeding day.

    * The :meth:`~pyrealm.splash.splash.SplashModel.estimate_initial_soil_moisture`
      method can be used to estimate an initial soil moisture for a time series from the
      first year of data in a time series.

    Args:
        lat: The latitude of observations
        elv: The elevation of observations (m), also used to calculate atmospheric
            pressure.

        tc: Air temperature (째C)
        pn: Precipitation (mm/day)

        This method uses the first year of data provided to a SplashModel instance to
        estimate initial values for the soil moisture data. The process assumes that the

        updates an initial guess at start of year soil moisture until those values are
        within a given tolerance of the end of year values. The method cannot be run

        initial guess of zero soil moisture in all sites . The user can also control the
        maximum number of update iterations and the accepted tolerance for convergence.
        The method will normally fail if the estimates do not converge, but the

        or horizontal transfer of water from the soil, only losses through
        evapotranspiration. Negative soil moisture values are replaced by zero.
