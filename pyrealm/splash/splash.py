    """Fitting the SPLASH model.

    The SplashModel class calculates the predictions of the SPLASH v1.0 model
    :cite:p:`davis:2017a`. The input variables of latitude, elevation, temperature,
    precipitation and sunshine fraction of observations are initially used to calculate
    solar and evaporative fluxes, which are stored in the ``solar`` and ``evap``
    attributes as instances of :class:`~pyrealm.splash.solar.DailySolarFluxes` and
    :class:`~pyrealm.splash.evap.DailyEvapFluxes`.



    From those initial calculations, the SPLASH model can then apply a simple
    calculation to iteratively track soil moisture and other evaporative fluxes through
    time.

        wn[t] = wn[t-1] + self.pn[t] + self.evap.cond[t] - self.evap.aet_d[t]

    Where the resulting soil moisture exceeds the maximum capacity of the soil (kWm),
    the excess is allocated to run off, leaving the soil saturated. The
    :meth:`~pyrealm.splash.splash.SplashModel.calc_splash_daily` method is used to
    calculate soil moisture and runoff for a given day, given the soil moisture of the
    preceeding day. The
    meth:`~pyrealm.splash.splash.SplashModel.equilibrate_soil_moisture` method can be
    used to estimate an initial soil moisture for a time series.

    The inputs to SplashModel are expected to be  numpy arrays with time varying along
    the first dimension. The dates argument is expected to be a Calendar object with the
    same length as the first dimension.
