"""The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel` module includes four submodules:

* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.pmodel` submodule provides classes implementing the core
  calculations of the P  Model.
* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.functions` submodule provides key standalone functions for
  those calculations.
* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.isotopes` submodule provides a class to estimate isotopic
  discrimination within the P Model.
* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.competition` submodule provides a competition model for the
  C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways.

Note that the documentation of functions and methods includes two lists of parameters:

Parameters
  These are the arguments specific to the class, method or function signature.

PModel Parameters
  These are shared parameters of the PModel used by this function, which are taken from
  a :mod:`~pyrealm.params.PModelParams` instance. These can be changed by the user but
  are typically used to configure an entire analysis rather than a single function.
