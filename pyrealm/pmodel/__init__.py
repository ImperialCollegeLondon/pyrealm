"""The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel` module includes four submodules:

* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.pmodel` submodule provides classes implementing the core
  calculations of the P  Model.
* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.functions` submodule provides key standalone functions for
  those calculations.
* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.isotopes` submodule provides a class to estimate isotopic
  discrimination within the P Model.
* The :mod:`~pyrealm.pmodel.competition` submodule provides a competition model for the
  C3 and C4 photosynthetic pathways.

Note that the documentation of functions and methods includes two lists of parameters:

Parameters
  These are the arguments specific to the class, method or function signature.

Constants
  These are shared parameters of the PModel , which are taken from the
  :class:`~pyrealm.constants.pmodel_const.PModelConst` dataclass. These can be changed
  by the user but are typically used to configure an entire analysis rather than a
  single function.
