Requirements
============

This code was successfully compiled and executed using Python 2.7 and Python 3.5
interpreters (Python Software Foundation, 2016).

This code requires the installation of third-party packages: NumPy (v.1.8.2,
v.1.10.4 by NumPy Developers, 2013) and SciPy (v.0.13.3, v.0.17.0 by SciPy
Developers, 2016) and references the basic date and time types (datetime),
logging facility (logging), Unix-style pathname pattern extension (glob), and
miscellaneous operating system interfaces (os) modules.

To run (Python 2/3):

`python main.py`
Results are printed to screen.
Requires input file (../../../data/example_data.csv).


To run tests (Python 2/3):

TEST 1:
`python solar.py`
Results are printed to file (solar.log)

TEST 2:
`python evap.py`
Results are printed to file (evap.log)

TEST 3:
`python splash.py`
Results are printed to file (splash.log) and screen.

To create input data (Python 2/3):

`python splash_data.py`
Results are printed to file (./out/splash_data_out.csv); make certain directory "out" exists before running.
