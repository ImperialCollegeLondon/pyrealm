# Provenance of the splash_py_version directory

This directory contains the original Python implementation of the SPLASH model,
developed by Tyler Davis, hosted at [https://bitbucket.org/labprentice/splash]. The
files here are the contents of the path: `releases/v1.0/py_version` from the `master`
branch of the repo at commit `52d9454b566d`.

This note and the `__init__.py` file to allow the module to be imported are the only
new files in the directory. The code files have been modified by `isort` and `black` but
are otherwise unchanged.
