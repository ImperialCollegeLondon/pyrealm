"""At present, this submodule only contains a single file containing the predictions for
the ``BE_Vie`` fluxnet site from the original implementation of the ``subdaily`` module,
published in :cite:`mengoli:2022a`. Generating these predictions requires an
installation of R and then code from the following repository:

`https://github.com/GiuliaMengoli/P-model_subDaily <https://github.com/GiuliaMengoli/P-model_subDaily>`_

TODO - This submodule should be updated to include the required code along with the
settings files and a runner script to reproduce this code. Or possibly to checkout the
required code as part of a shell script.
